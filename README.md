Brazilian eCommerce Dataset - Customer Analysis &amp; Segmentation

In this project, I explored the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist to uncover key insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. My primary objectives were identifying top-selling products, analyzing customer purchase patterns, and evaluating review scores across different product categories.

My analysis revealed that electronics were consistently the top-selling category, with peak sales occurring during holidays. I also observed that customers who made repeat purchases tended to have higher overall satisfaction, as indicated by their review scores.

These findings have significant business implications. By leveraging this data, Olist can optimize inventory management, tailor marketing strategies to peak shopping periods, and enhance customer satisfaction through targeted engagement.

Technically, I faced challenges with implementing recursive CTEs and complex queries as these techniques proved invaluable in extracting meaningful insights. Using CTEs and window functions allowed me to perform efficient and effective data analysis.

Despite the valuable insights, my analysis had limitations, such as the absence of detailed customer demographic information. Future research could delve deeper into customer lifetime value and predictive modeling to forecast customer churn.

In conclusion, this project provided actionable recommendations to improve business performance. Continuous monitoring and analysis of sales data are essential to adapt to market trends and maintain a competitive advantage.
